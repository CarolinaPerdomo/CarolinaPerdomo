### Hello outsider ðŸ‘‹:smile_cat: I'm Carolina.

# :nerd_face: About nerd me (research and code):

- :zany_face: I have a Ph.D. from Universidade Federal do ABC, Brazil. I am a researcher in theoretical particle physics.
- :computer: I develop and test regularization algorithms with Mathematica for the study of theoretical models in particle physics.
- :ear: As a researcher, one of my responsibilities is to transmit knowledge. The ability to communicate technical aspects in a clear way has been a crucial part of my work. Check part of my Ph.D. presentations in [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/Presentations-during-Ph.D.).
<!-- - :scroll: I have collaborated in: ["Two-loop renormalisation of gauge theories in 4D Implicit Regularisation: transition rules to dimensional methods"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09259-6), ["A Brief Review of Implicit Regularization and Its Connection with the BPHZ Theorem"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/6/956), and ["Two-loop renormalisation of non-Abelian gauge theories in 4D Implicit Regularisation"](https://pos.sissa.it/398/725). -->
- :custard: I did a research internship at Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal. I defined and designed the current tools that I use in my thesis.
<!-- - :croissant: I did my master's degree in experimental physics at UniversitÃ© Paris Diderot, France. -->
- :woman_technologist: I did an internship in experimental physics and data science with C++ and Python during my M2 (UniversitÃ© Paris Diderot). To check this projects go [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/M2_Data_Projects).
<!-- :atom: I have participated in several pop-science activities: as a volunteer at the Hospital de NiÃ±os Dr. J. M. de los RÃ­os (:venezuela: Venezuela) and as a science blog ghostwriter (UpWork).
- :woman_teacher: I have held positions as teaching assistant (Universidad SimÃ³n BolÃ­var and UFABC). -->

# :cowboy_hat_face: About mortal me (hobbies and others):

- :zombie_woman: I love survival horror video games and horror movies.
- :musical_keyboard: I studied music and academic piano for many years. I have been a music teacher for children between 5-11 years old.
- :tongue: I speak Spanish (native), English (bilingual with a tropical accent :palm_tree:), Portuguese (C1), and French (B2) fluently.

# :brain: [Personal] Projects:

- :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: Doing the 100 days of code. To check the progress, go [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/100-days-of-code/blob/master/log.md).
- :mechanical_arm: Learning Qiskit and getting familiar with quantum algorithms. Current project in [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/Project-VQA-for-DE-with-Qiskit).
- :chess_pawn: Studying ML in Mathematica by creating my own chess AI.
- :paintbrush: I always like to draw a fat orange "cat": [Carrot](https://www.instagram.com/auyama_zanahoria/).
