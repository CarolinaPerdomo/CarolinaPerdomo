### Hello outsider üëã:smile_cat: I'm Carolina.

# :nerd_face: About nerd me (research and code):

- :woman_scientist: Currently working as data scientist in the automobile sector. Also as a voluntary Quantum Fellow supervising a quantum machine learning project.
- :zany_face: I have a Ph.D. from Universidade Federal do ABC, Brazil. I am a researcher in theoretical particle physics.
- :computer: I develop and test regularization algorithms with Mathematica for the study of theoretical models in particle physics. For more about that, you can check [this](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/Thesis) repository.
- :ear: As a researcher, one of my responsibilities is to transmit knowledge. The ability to communicate technical aspects in a clear way has been a crucial part of my work. Check part of my Ph.D. presentations in [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/Presentations-during-Ph.D.). For my presentations post-Ph.D. as invited speaker, or participating in conferences, etc, check [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/Presentations-after-PhD/blob/main/README.md).
<!-- - :scroll: I have collaborated in: ["Two-loop renormalisation of gauge theories in 4D Implicit Regularisation: transition rules to dimensional methods"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-021-09259-6), ["A Brief Review of Implicit Regularization and Its Connection with the BPHZ Theorem"](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/13/6/956), and ["Two-loop renormalisation of non-Abelian gauge theories in 4D Implicit Regularisation"](https://pos.sissa.it/398/725). -->
- :custard: I did a research internship at Universidade de Coimbra, Portugal. I defined and designed the current tools that I used in my thesis. To obtain this funding we researched and developed a grant proposal.
<!-- - :croissant: I did my master's degree in experimental physics at Universit√© Paris Diderot, France. -->
- :woman_technologist: I did an internship in experimental physics and data science with C++ and Python during my M2 (Universit√© Paris Diderot). To check these projects go [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/M2_Data_Projects).
- :briefcase: I am deeply passionate about working with data and I am actively cultivating the practice of showcasing a diverse array of data projects here in order to enhance my professional portfolio. You can check the [projects](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/DS-Projects) and the [micro-projects](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/microDS-Projects). I am always open to feedback. For Quantum Computing projects, check [here](https://github.com/CarolinaPerdomo/studyingQC).
- :atom: I have been involved in various pop-science initiatives, including volunteering at Hospital de Ni√±os Dr. J. M. de los R√≠os in Venezuela, writing for a science blog on UpWork, working as a science content writer in France, and now working on my Quantum Computing educational project called [<Quantum|Chamitas>](https://drcarolinaperdomo.com/empowering-young-venezuelan-girls-in-quantum-education/).
- :woman_teacher: I have served as a teaching assistant at both Universidad Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and UFABC. Additionally, I have experience working as a high school physics teacher and private physics tutor.

# :cowboy_hat_face: About mortal me (hobbies and others):

- :zombie_woman: I love survival horror video games and horror movies.
- :musical_keyboard: I studied music and academic piano for many years. I have been a music teacher for children between 5-11 years old.
- :tongue: I speak Spanish (native), English (bilingual with a tropical accent :palm_tree:), Portuguese (C1), and French (B2) fluently.
- :paintbrush: I always like to draw a fat orange "cat": [Carrot](https://www.instagram.com/auyama_zanahoria/).
